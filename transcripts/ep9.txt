STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER

The dead speak! The galaxy has heard a mysterious broadcast, a threat of revenge in the sinister voice of the late Emperor Palpatine.

General Leia Organa dispatches secret agents to gather intelligence, while Rey, the last hope of the Jedi, trains for battle against the diabolical First Order.

Meanwhile, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren rages in search of the phantom Emperor, determined to destroy any threat to his power....

[The crawl finishes. Pan across the star field to follow three First Order TIE ships soaring to a Star Destroyer as it hovers in front of the volcanic planet Mustafar]

EXT. MUSTAFAR - CORVAX FEN - FOREST - DAY

[In Corvax Fen, the forest of scorched irontrees on the planet surface, small fires lick the ground and charge trunks. SUPREME LEADER KYLO REN, alias BEN SOLO, now 30, uses his lightsaber to cut down Mustafarian warriors known as the ALAZMEC OF WINSIT wearing helmets outfitted with glowing yellow light to resembling eyes. With First Order stormtroopers easily taking down the natives with blasters, Kylo Ren runs straight to the warrior, slamming it to the ground. Sliding backwards, Kylo Ren spreads a small ground fire as he thrusts his lightsaber through an Alazmec behind him. Using the Force, he draws a guard to him and dispatches it before cutting off another's right arm. Eventually, he stops, breathing heavily. All of the Mustafarians are dead. Kylo then pushes the lid of a tomb the warriors had been protecting. He pulls a triangular device out of it. The Sith Wayfinder has been found. The camera zooms in at the device]

EXT. SPACE

[It transitions to Kylo Ren's Silencer, being steered through a red nebula. Kylo seems determined when he reaches his destination]

EXT. EXEGOL - DESERT - DAY

[The enormous Sith temple comes into view, shrouded in darkness and lightning. Ren leaves his ship, draws his lightsaber and activates it as he walks to the temple's opening. Brief cut to black. A hexagonal platform is lowered down into the catacombs of the planet. A familiar, ominous voice fills the air]

PALPATINE: At last...

[Ren seems uneasy. He walks through the darkness. Lightning shows the room is filled with gigantic statues from Sith leaders]

PALPATINE: Snoke... trained you well...

KYLO REN: I killed Snoke. I’ll kill you.

PALPATINE: My boy... I made Snoke... (when Kylo stands still) I have been every voice.... (as Snoke) ....you have ever heard.... (as Darth Vader) ....inside your head.

[As Darth Vader's iconic gasps vanish, we're shown a different part of the ruins. Sith acolytes are connecting wires to a tank, which contains mangled bodies, several mutilated copies of Snoke. Kylo passes it, coming closer and closer to where the voice is coming from]

PALPATINE: The First Order was just the beginning... I will give you so much more...

KYLO REN: You’ll die first.

PALPATINE: I have died before.

[The leader of the First Order turns his head and steps towards the voice]

PALPATINE: The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be....

[Lightning illuminates Palpatine's face]

PALPATINE: ...unnatural.

[It's clear that, whatever the Emperor has been using to sustain himself, hasn't been kind to him. His body is frail, his skin pale, his eyes empty. Ren lifts his saber, holding it mere inches away from the Emperor's throat]

KYLO REN: What could you give me?

PALPATINE: (determined) Everything.

[He spreads his mangled fingers. Force lightning sparkles between them]

PALPATINE: A new Empire.

[The Imperial March makes itself heard as a massive fleet of Star Destroyers break through the icy surface of Exegol]

PALPATINE: The might of the Final Order will soon be ready. It will be yours if you do as I ask. Kill the girl! End the Jedi.... and become what your grandfather Vader could not.

[Kylo Ren lowers his lightsaber]

PALPATINE: You will rule all the galaxy as the new Emperor. But beware.... she is not who you think she is.

KYLO REN: Who is she?

[Thunder rumbles as Palpatine smiles. Cut to black]

EXT. HYPERSPACE

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

[Game pieces chittering]

[Chewbacca grunting softly]

POE: Are you ever going to go?

FINN: He can't beat us every time.

POE: Apparently he does.

FINN: How does he do it?

POE: This guy right here? It's cause he cheats.

[Groans]

POE: I'm kidding!

FINN: Oh, come on. Take your turn.

POE: You're 250 years old.

FINN: You're taking forever. That's cheating.

POE: Of course you're better than this.

FINN:That's why we think you're cheating.

[Electronic chiming]

[Chewie grunting]

FINN: Don't worry!

POE: We're not going to turn it off.

[Chewie groans]

FINN: He's cheating.

POE: Definitely. Klaud, I hope you fixed that surge.

[Klaud responds in alien language]

POE: T-minus 5.

[R2-D2 chirps]

FINN: R2.

[R2-D2 chirps]

FINN: Boolio, good to see you. You got something for us?

BOOLIO: From a new ally. A spy in the First Order!

FINN: A spy? Who?

BOOLIO: I don't know. Transfer the message! Give it to Leia, hurry!

[R2-D2 chirps]

FINN: This could be big, R2.

[R2-D2 chirps]

[Beeps]

TIE PILOT: Locked on target.

POE: Finn, we're about to be cooked!

FINN: We're almost there!!!

[Beeping]

FINN: Poe, we got it. How do we thank you?

BOOLIO: Win the war!

[Chewie groans]

POE: Sorry, I'm sorry! I know! Finn, you're supposed to be getting of those things!

FINN: Ooh! I got one!

POE: How many are left?

FINN: Too many.

[Groans]

POE: What?!

[Continues grunting]

POE: Good thinking, Chewie. Finn, we can boulder these TIEs!

FINN: I was just thinking that. Ha! Get us back to base!

POE: How thick do you think that ice wall is?

[Grunts]

[Finn grunts]

FINN: Poe?!

POE: I know, I know!

FINN: What are you dong?!

POE: Lightspeed skipping.

FINN: How do you know how to do that?

[Chewie groans]

POE: Yeah, well, Rey's not here, is she?

[Alarm wails]

POE: Last jump, maybe forever.

[Klaud screams]

POE: Hold on!!!

EXT. AJAN KLOSS - JUNGLE - DAY

[Animals chittering in distance as she’s practicing using the Force with Leia training her]

REY: (softly) Be with me. Be with me. Be with me. (opens her eyes) They’re not with me. Ugh.

LEIA: Rey. Be patient.

REY: (sighs) I’m starting to think it isn't impossible.... to hear the voices of the Jedi who came before.

LEIA: Nothing's impossible.

REY: Nothing's impossible. I’m going to run the training course.

[Panting]

[Grunting]

[Soft chime]

[Soft chime]

[Grunts]

[Grunting]

[Groans]

[Panting]

[Screams]

[Rey gasps]

YOUNG REY: No!

KYLO REN: (echoing) Join me.

DARTH VADER: Join me.

LUKE: Ben, no! You killed him!

HAN: Ben!

[Whimpering softly]

[BB-8 chirping]

REY: BB-8, I'm so sorry. I didn’t finish the training course. Got distracted. I’m just not feeling myself. I know it looks.... it looks like I’m making excuses.

LEIA: Don’t tell me what things look like. Tell me what they are.

REY: I think I’m just tired. That’s all.

KAYDEL KO CONNIX: General.... the Falcon still hasn't arrived. Commander's asking for guidance.

[Rey hands back Luke’s lightsaber to Leia]

REY: I will earn your brother’s saber.... one day.

[BB-8 chirping]

REY: No, you can’t do it for me.

LEIA: Never underestimate a droid.

[Leia walks off]

REY: Yes, Master.

[Man giving instructions]

NIMI CHIREEN: Rey! Falcon's back!

[All clamoring]

MAN: Come on, get over here!

MAN 2: I need a fire crew here! And another one in the back! Go, go!!!

WOMAN: Coming!

POE: It's on fire!

[BB-8 whines]

POE: Whole thing's on fire. All of it. It's on fire.

REY: Hey.

POE: Hey!

REY: There's a spy?

POE: Really could have used your help out there.

REY: How did it go?

POE: Really bad, actually. Really bad.

REY: Han’s ship....

[referring to BB-8]

POE: What'd you do to the droid?

REY: What'd you do the Falcon?

POE: The Falcon’s in a lot better shape than he is.

REY: BB-8's not on fire.

POE: What’s left of him isn’t on fire.

REY: Tell me what happened.

POE: You tell me first.

REY: You know what you are?

Poe Dameron: What?

Rey: You’re difficult. Really difficult. You’re a difficult man.

Poe Dameron: You, you are....

Finn: Rey.

Rey: Finn. Oh.

[BB-8 chirps]

REY: You made it back.

FINN: Yeah. Barely.

REY: So, bad mood?

FINN: Me?

[points to Poe]

REY: Him.

FINN: Always.

REY: Do we have a spy?

FINN: Well....

[Chewie grunts]

REY: You lightspeed skipped?

POE: Yeah, well, it got us back here, didn't it?

REY: Poe, the compressor's down.

POE: Oh, I know, I was there.

FINN: Every time.

REY: You can't lightspeed skip the Falcon!

POE: Actually, it turns out you can.

FINN: All right, guys, we just landed, okay?

REY: What happened?

POE: Bad news, that's what happened.

REY: No spy?

POE: No. Spy.

REY: Did we make contact with a spy or not?

FINN: There's a mole in the First Order, and they sent us a message.

POE: You dropped a tree on him?

REY: You blew both sub-alternators?

POE: Well, you know what.... maybe you should've been out there with us!

REY: You know I want to be out there with you.

POE: Yeah, but you're not. You're here training. For what? You're the best fighter we have. We need you. Out there, not here. Junior.... get R2 into reconditioning.

FINN: It's true.

REY: What's the message?

POE: We’ve decoded the intel from the First Order spy.... and it confirms the worst. (sighs) Somehow, Palpatine returned.

[All gasp, murmuring]

ROSE: Wait. Do we believe this?

AFTAB: It cannot be. The Emperor's dead.

BEAUMONT: Dark science. Cloning. Secrets only the Sith knew.

[referring to Palpatine]

POE: He’s been planning his revenge. His followers have been building something for years. The largest fleet the galaxy has ever known. He calls it the Final Order. In 16 hours, attacks on all free worlds begin.

[Chewie groans]

POE: The Emperor and his fleet have been hiding in the Unknown Regions. On a world called Exegol.

[R2-D2 chirps frantically]

C-3PO: Exegol does not appear on any star chart. But legend describes it as a hidden world of the Sith.

BEAUMONT: There were always whispers of his hunger to cheat death.

POE: So, Palpatine’s been out there all the time. Pulling the strings.

LEIA: Always. In the shadows. From the very beginning.

MAZ: If we want to stop him, we must find him. Must find Exegol.

REY: General? Can I speak with you? I know how to get to Exegol.

LEIA: Tell me.

REY: Luke searched for it. For a long time. He nearly found it.

[referring to Luke’s notes]

REY: There are ciphers here I can’t read. But he said to get there, you need one of these. A Sith wayfinder. They’re compasses that lead the way to Exegol. To stop what we both know is coming.... I need to finish what Luke started. Find Exegol. Find the Emperor.

LEIA: No.

REY: I don’t want to go without your blessing, but I will.

[Leia just looks at her]

REY: I will. It’s what you would do.

POE: So, you got her up and running?

REY: You were right before. I'm going to pick up Luke's search for Exegol. I'm going to start where his trail went cold. The Forbidden Desert of Pasaana.

[after Rey’s told them she’s going to look for Exegol]

POE: Yeah, I know. We’re going with you.

[he walks towards the Falcon]

POE: Chewie, you get that compressor fixed?

[Chewie grunts]

REY: I need to go alone.

FINN: Yeah. Alone with friends.

REY: It’s too dangerous, Finn.

FINN: We go together.

[Chewie grunts]

[BB-8 chirping]

C-3PO: I wholeheartedly agree.

[Rey smiles, chuckling softly]

FINN: Rose, last chance.

ROSE: The General asked me to study the specs of the old Destroyers. So we can stop the fleet if you find it.

FINN: "If"?

ROSE: (chuckles softly) When.

FINN: When.

POE: Hey, we should get going. What is it?

REY: Nothing.

[as he’s setting off to go off with Rey, Finn and Poe]

C-3PO: In the event that I do not return.... I want you to know that you have been a real friend R2. My best one, in fact.

[R2-D2 chirps happily]

REY: There’s so much I want to tell you.

LEIA: Tell me when you get back.

[she gives Rey Luke’s lightsaber and Rey embraces her affectionately]

[Rey sniffles]

LEIA: Rey.... never be afraid of who you are.

[Grunts]

REY: It is.

[Muttering]

[Continues muttering]

STORMTROOPER 1: Knights of Ren.

STORMTROOPER 2: Ghouls.

KYLO REN: We have a spy in our ranks.... who just sent a message to the Resistance. Whoever this traitor is won't stop us. With what I've seen on Exegol.... the First Order is about to become a true Empire.

[pause]

KYLO REN: I sense unease about my appearance, General Hux.

ARMITAGE HUX: About the mask? No, sir. Well done.

BELLAVA PARNADEE: I like it.

DOMARIC QUINN: Forgive me, sir, but these allies on Exegol.... they sound like a cult. Conjurers and soothsayers.

ENRIC PRYDE: They've conjured legions of Star Destroyers. The Sith fleet will increase our resources 10-1,000fold. Such range and power will correct the error of Starkiller Base.

AMRET ENGELL: We'll need to increase recruitments. Harvest more of the galaxy's young.

DOMARIC QUINN: This fleet, what is it, a gift? What is he asking for in return?

[Choking]

KYLO REN: Prepare to crush any worlds that defy us. My knights and I are going hunting for the scavenger.

POE: You sure this is it?

C-3PO: These are the exact coordinates that Master Luke left behind.

[Upbeat folk music playing]

[Crowd cheering]

POE: What is this?

C-3PO: The Acky Acky Festival of the Ancestors. This celebration occurs only once every 42 years.

FINN: Well, that's lucky.

C-3PO: Lucky, indeed. This festival is known for both its colorful kites.... and its delectable sweets.

[Upbeat folk music continues]

[Light-hearted chanting]

[All chanting rhythmically]

REY: I've never seen anything like this.

FINN: I've never seen so few wayfinders.

POE: There's always random First Order patrols in crowds like these. So, keep your heads down. Chewie.

[Chewie grunting]

[Upbeat folk music continues]

[Baby alien gurgling]

POE: Let's split up. See what the locals know.

[Male alien urging]

[Creature grunting]

[Male alien telling story in alien language]

[Little aliens giggling]

[translating for the female alien they’ve encountered.]

C-3PO: She is saying, "Welcome."

[Female alien speaking alien language]

[the alien gives Rey a necklace and puts it around her neck]

C-3PO: Her name is Nambi Ghima.

REY: That’s an excellent name. I’m Rey.

[Speaks alien language]

C-3PO: She would be honored to know your family name, too.

[pause]

REY: I don’t have one. I’m just Rey.

[Quiet rumbling]

[Music and chatter quiet]

[Kylo reaches Rey through their force bond]

KYLO REN: Palpatine wants you dead.

REY: Serving another master?

KYLO REN: No. I have other plans. I offered you my hand once. You wanted to take it. Why didn’t you?

REY: You could've killed me. Why didn’t you?

KYLO REN: You can’t hide, Rey. Not from me.

REY: I see through the cracks in your mask. You’re haunted. You can’t stop seeing what you did to your father.

KYLO REN: Do you still count the days since your parents left? Such pain in you, such anger. I don’t want to have to kill you. I’m going to find you and I’m going to turn you to the dark side. When I offer you my hand again.... you’ll take it.

Rey: We’ll see.

[Kylo suddenly reaches out and grabs the necklace Nambi gave her]

[Chatter resumes]

[Panting]

POE: Has he seen him?

REY: We have to go. Back to the Falcon. Now.

FINN: Why?

REY: It's Ren.

TISHRA KANDIA: Sir, we've had this analyzed. It comes from the Middian System, Pasaana, Forbidden Valley.

KYLO REN: Prepare my ship. Alert the local troops. Send a division.

ENRIC PRYDE: Yes, Supreme Leader.

STORMTROOPER: Freeze. Hold it right there. I've located the Resistance fugitives. All units, report....

[Groans]

MAN: Follow me. Hurry. Leia sent me a transmission.

[Man speaks alien language]

KALO'NE:Okay.

[after a masked man helps them to escape from a stormtrooper]

Finn: How'd you find us?

[the man takes off his mask to reveal himself to be Lando Calrissian, now 65]

LANDO: Wookies standout in a crowd.

[Chewie moans]

[Laughs]

[BB-8 chirps]

LANDO: It's good to see you, too, old buddy.

C-3PO: This is General Lando Calrissian.

REY: We know who he is, 3PO.

FINN: It is an honor, General.

POE: General Calrissian, we're looking for Exegol.

LANDO: Of course, you are. Only 2 were made.

REY: A Sith wayfinder.

[BB-8 chirps]

REY: Luke Skywalker came here to find one.

LANDO: (chuckles) I know. I was with him. Luke and I were tailing an old Jedi hunting. Ochi of Bestoon. He was carrying a clue that could lead to a wayfinder. We followed his ship halfway across the galaxy here. When we got to his ship, it was abandoned.... No clue. No wayfinder.

REY: Is Ochi's ship still here?

LANDO: It's out in the desert, where he left it.

REY: We need to get to that ship. Search for it.

[Engines whirring in distance]

LANDO: I got a bad feeling about this. Ochi's ship is out past Lurch Canyon. Go.

POE: Thank you, General.

[Grunts softly]

LANDO: You, too, Chewie.

REY: Leia needs pilots, General.

LANDO: My flying days are long gone. But do me a favor.... give Leia my love.

REY: You should give it to her yourself. Thank you.

[Rey leaves]

POE: There! Those speeders!

[Speeder powers up]

FINN: How do you know how to do that?

C-3PO: No need to worry. I made it.

[Male aliens exclaiming and shouting]

POE: We got to go.

STORMTROOPER: (into comlink) We spotted the fugitives.

[Finn yelps]

[Grunts]

[BB-8 chirping]

[we see the rebels being chased by Stormtroopers who are also using jetpacks to fly]

[Chewie grunts]

C-3PO: Oh! They fly now!

FINN: They fly now?!

POE: They fly now! Did we lose them?!

FINN: Looks like it!

C-3PO: Excellent job, sir! Terrible job, sir!

[BB-8 chirping]

REY: Not now, BB-8.

[Screams]

REY: Never underestimate a droid.

[Grunts]

FINN: Poe?!

[Yelps]

[Screams]

FINN: Whoo!!!

POE: Yeah!!! (laughs)

C-3PO: Right, ho!

[Groaning]

REY: Ochi's ship. I've seen that ship before.

POE: Rey!

FINN: You get all of them?

[Rey screams]

[All yelling]

[Chewie groans]

[Rey grunts]

[Engine whining]

[Grunting]

POE: What the hell is this?!

[BB-8 chirps frantically]

[as they are sinking in through the quicksand]

REY: Sinking fields! Try to grab something!

C-3PO: Will this agony ever end?!

POE: Come on!

REY: BB-8! No!

[BB-8 chirps in panic]

FINN: Rey! Rey, I never told you....

REY: What?! Finn!

[they all sink]

[Muffled chirping]

[Woman giving instructions]

SNAP: General. We're getting reports of a raid at the Festival of Ancestors.

LEIA: This mission is everything. We cannot fail. Any words from Rey?

SNAP: Falcon’s not responding.

ROSE: Do you have to say it like that?

SNAP: Like what?

LEIA: Do me a personal favor? Be optimistic.

SNAP: Yes, ma’am. Uh, this is.... This is terrific. You’re not going to believe how well this is going to turn out.

[Rose sighs, turns and walks away]

SNAP: It’s going to be great.

[BB-8 chirping]

[after they sink in through the sand and end up in underground tunnels]

[Poe groaning]

[Spits]

POE: Rey! Finn!

C-3PO: You didn’t say my name, sir, but I’m all right.

[Muffled grunting]

POE: You all right?

REY: Yeah. Where's Finn?

POE: Where's Chewie?

[Chewie groaning]

FINN: I'm good.

C-3PO: Ah. Master Finn.

[after they end up in the underground tunnels]

FINN: What is this place?

C-3PO: This isn’t the afterlife, is it? Are droids allowed in here?

POE: I thought we were goners.

C-3PO: We might still be.

FINN: Which way out?

REY: We have to hurry. So, what was it?

FINN: What?

REY: What you were going to tell me?

FINN: When?

REY: When you were sinking in the sand, you said.... "I never told you...."

FINN: I’ll tell you later.

POE: You mean when Poe’s not here?

FINN: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

POE: We’re going to die in sand burrows and we’re all keeping secrets?

FINN: I’ll tell you when you tell us about all that shifty stuff you do.

[Chewie grunts]

POE: I don't want to know what made these tunnels.

C-3PO: Judging by the circumference of the tunnel walls....

POE: I said I do not want to know. Not. What's that?

FINN: Is that a speeder?

REY: What? An old one.

C-3PO: Perhaps we will find the driver.

[BB-8 chirping]

POE: Yep, BB-8, I think dead, too.

C-3PO: Oh, my. A hex charm.

POE: A what?

C-3PO: A common emblem of Sith loyalists.

REY: Sith.

FINN: This was Ochi's?

REY: Luke sensed it. Ochi never left this place.

FINN: And he ended up down here.

POE: He was headed for his ship. Same thing happened to us, happened to him.

FINN: So, how did Ochi get out?

REY: He didn't.

[Chewie groans]

[after they find Ochi’s bones in the underground tunnel]

FINN: No, he didn't.

POE: Bones. I don’t like bones.

C-3PO: Bones? Never a good sign.

[BB-8 chirping]

REY: Yeah, I see it.

[after finding the dagger in the underground tunnel]

[Woman whimpers]

REY: (whispers) Horrible things.... have happened with this.

POE: There's writing on it.

C-3PO: Perhaps I can translate. Oh. The location of the wayfinder, has been inscribed upon this dagger. It’s the clue that Master Luke was looking for.

POE: And?

FINN: Where’s the wayfinder?

C-3PO: I am afraid I cannot tell you.

POE: 20.3 fazillion languages, and you can’t read that?

C-3PO: Oh, I have read it, sir. I know exactly where the wayfinder is. Unfortunately, it is written in the runic language of the Sith.

REY: So what?

C-3PO: My programming forbids me from translating it.

POE: So, you’re telling us the one time we need you to talk, you can’t?

C-3PO: Irony, sir. I am mechanically incapable of speaking translations from Sith. I believe the rule was passed by the Senate of the Old Republic....

[just then a giant sand worm appears behind C-3PO]

[BB-8 yelps]

[Snarling]

C-3PO: Serpent, serpent, serpent!!!

[Rey panting]

[BB-8 chirps softly]

[Creature growls]

FINN: Rey.

[Hissing]

[Snarling]

POE: Finn?

FINN: Shh.

[Creature growls softly]

[Hissing]

POE: I'm going to blast it.

FINN: Don't blast it.

[Growls softly]

[Rey breathing nervously]

[Groaning]

[Breathing deeply]

[Creature moans]

[after Rey healing the sand worm that was about to attack them]

[Creature chitters softly]

[Poe sighing with relief]

[BB-8 chirps]

REY: I just transferred a bit of life. Force energy from me to him.

[BB-8 chirps]

REY: You would've done the same.

[after leaving the underground tunnel]

C-3PO: We cannot possibly fly in that old wreck . POE: We got to keep moving. Find someone who can translate that dagger. Like a helpful droid.

C-3PO: I suggest we return to the Millennium Falcon at once.

POE: They’ll be waiting for us at the Falcon.

FINN: Yeah, they’ll throw us in the Pits of Griq.

POE: Yeah. And use you as a target droid.

C-3PO: You both make excellent points, at times.

FINN: What is it?

REY: I'll be right behind you. It's okay.

POE: Let's see what we got. Let's get those converters fired up.

C-3PO: (shudders) What a filthy ship!

[Ship powering up]

POE: Look at that.

FINN: Where is she?

POE: Finn, help me out over here.

FINN: Chewie, tell Rey we got to go.

[Grunts]

[Panting]

[Engine roaring in distance]

POE: What's she doing? Where the hell's Chewie?

FINN: It's Ren.

[Indistinct chatter in distance]

STORMTROOPER: All right, let's go. Get in the transport.

STORMTROOPER 2: Move, animal!

[Breathing heavily]

[Engine roaring in distance]

[Rey panting]

[Alarm wailing]

[Metal screeching]

[Engine whining]

FINN: Rey! Rey!

[Engine whirring]

FINN: They got Chewie! They got him!

[Grunting]

[Straining]

[Panting]

[Grunts]

[after Rey accidentally destroys the First Order transport that had captured Chewie with Force lightning]

REY: Chewie!!!

FINN: No!!!

[Gasping]

POE: Rey! We got to go! They're coming!

FINN: Rey, come on!!!

[Breathing shakily]

FINN: Rey!

POE: We got to go!

REY: (whispers) Chewie.

FINN: Rey, come on!!!

[Gasping]

REY: I lost control.

FINN: It wasn’t your fault.

REY: It was.

FINN: No. It was Ren. He made you do it.

REY: Chewie’s gone. That power came from me. Finn, there are things you don’t know.

FINN: Then tell me.

[pause, breathing shakily]

REY: I, uh, had a vision. Of the throne of the Sith. And who was on it.

FINN: Ren?

REY: (inhales sharply) And me.

ARMITAGE HUX: We recovered the scavenger's ship, but she got away. Under the command of the Knights of Ren, we suffered losses. A transport was destroyed.

ENRIC PRYDE: I've seen the report. That all?

ARMITAGE HUX: No, Alligiant General. There was another transport in the desert. It brought back a valuable prisoner.

ENRIC PRYDE: Prisoner?

[Chewie groaning]

ARMITAGE HUX: The beast used to fly with Han Solo.

[Roars]

ENRIC PRYDE: Take it to Interrogation 6.

STORMTROOPER: Move it.

POE: We've only got 8 hours left. So, what are we going to do?

FINN: What can we do? We got to go back to base.

POE: We don’t have time to go back. We are not giving up. If we do that, Chewie died for nothing.

FINN: Poe, Chewie had the dagger!

POE: Well, then we got to find another way.

FINN: Well, there isn’t. That was the only clue to the wayfinder thing, and it’s gone.

C-3PO: So true. The inscription lives only in my memory now.

POE: Hold on. The inscription that was on the dagger is in your memory?

C-3PO: Yes, Master Poe. But the translation from a forbidden language cannot be retrieved. That is short of a complete redacted memory bypass.

FINN: A complete what?

C-3PO: It’s a terribly dangerous and sinful act.... performed on unwitting droids by dregs and criminals.

FINN: Let’s do that.

POE: I know a black market droidsmith.

C-3PO: Black market droidsmith?

POE: But he's on Kijimi.

FINN: What's wrong with Kijimi?

POE: I had a little bad luck on Kijimi. But if this mission fails, it’s all been for nothing. All we’ve done, all this time.

FINN: We’re all in this. (looks over to Rey) Until the end.

[Rey takes his hand]

REY: For Chewie.

[Finn holds his hand to Poe]

POE: Hands?

FINN: Hands.

[Poe takes his hand]

POE: For Chewie. Kijimi.

[C-3PO comes over and takes Poe’s hand]

[BB-8 chirps softly]

[BB-8 chirps]

[Powering up]

D-O: Battery charged. Hello.

[BB-8 chirping]

D-O: Hello.

REY: Hello.

D-O: No.... No, thank you.

[BB-8 chirping]

REY: Looks like someone treated him badly. It's all right. You're with us now.

[BB-8 chirps softly]

[after they arrive on Kijimi]

ANNOUNCER: (on P.A.) U-A-T-T walker patrol, head down Thoroughfare 60.

[Alarm wailing]

[Banging on door]

[Angry chatter]

STORMTROOPER: Open up. You're wanted for questioning.

[Banging on door]

STORMTROOPER 2: Check this side of the street.

[Alien speaks alien language]

[Alien gasps]

STORMTROOPER 3: Door is locked. Move on to the next one.

STORMTROOPER 4: Give me regular reports, please.

STORMTROOPER 5: You, up against the wall. Show me your identification. Where's your identification?

POE: They're everywhere.

[Woman shouts]

WOMAN: Please! Leave her alone! She didn't do anything.

POE: Alright, I know what we should do.

C-3PO: So do I. We should leave.

POE: Clam it, 3PO. Follow me. All right. Let's head down this way.

[as they bump into Zorii Bliss on Kijimi]

ZORII: Heard you were spotted at Monk's Gate. Thought, "He's not stupid enough to come back here."

POE: Oh, you'd be surprised.

REY: Who's this?

FINN: What's going on?

POE: Guys, this is Zorii. Zorii, this is Rey and Finn.

ZORII: I could pull this trigger right now.

POE: I've seen you do worse.

ZORII: For a lot less.

POE: Can we just, uh.... talk about this?

ZORII: I want to see your brains in the snow.

POE: So you’re still mad? Zorii, we could use your help. We got to crack this droid’s head open and fast.

C-3PO: Pardon me!

POE: We’re trying to find Babu Frik.

ZORII: Babu? Babu only works with the crew. That’s not you anymore.

REY: What crew?

ZORII: Oh, funny he never mentioned it. Your friend’s old job was running spice.

FINN: You were a spice runner?

POE: You were a stormtrooper?

REY: Were you a spice runner?

POE: Were you a scavenger? We could do this all night.

ZORII: You don't have all night. You know, I'm still digging out of the hole you put me in when you left to join the Resistance. You. You're the one they're looking for. Bounty for her just might cover us. Djak'kankah!!!

POE: Don't djak'kankah.

[All grunting]

[Both panting]

REY: We could really use your help. Please.

ZORII: Not that you care.... (continues panting) ... but I think you're okay.

REY: I care.

STORMTROOPER 1: T-18's online yet?

STORMTROOPER 2: Yes, sir. Scouting the perimeter.

ZORII: Walkers. Stay close by.

FINN: Poe Dameron, spice runner. Runner of spice.

POE: All right.

FINN: Get your spice!

REY: Come on, 3PO.

C-3PO. Oh.

ZORII: Babu's in the back.

[Indistinct chatter and laughter]

[Upbeat fusion music playing]

[Alien speaks alien language]

C-3PO: Don't mind us.

[as 3PO is having his memory unlocked]

C-3PO: I haven’t the faintest idea why I agreed to this. I must be malfunctioning. I must be malfunctioning.

REY: Babu Frik? Can you help us with this?

[Speaking alien language]

REY: Zorii? Is this going to work?

[Zorri and Babu Frik conversing alien language]

ZORII: He says he's found something in your droid's forbidden memory bank. Words, translated from Sith.

REY: That's it.

FINN: Yeah, that's what we need.

ZORII: Who are you hanging out with that speaks Sith?

[referring to 3PO]

POE: Can you make him.... Babu, can you make him translate it?

[Zorri and Babu Frik conversing alien language]

[Zorii translates for Babu]

ZORII: Yes. But it will cause a complete....

C-3PO: A complete memory wipe.

POE: Wait, wait, wait. We make him translate it.... he won’t remember.... anything?

BABU: Droid, memory go blank.

C-3PO: Oh!

BABU: Blank, blank.

C-3PO: There must be some other way.

FINN: Doesn’t R2 back up your memory?

C-3PO: Oh, please. R2’s storage units are famously unreliable.

REY: You know the odds better than any of us. Do we have a choice?

[pause]

C-3PO: If this mission fails.... it was all for nothing. All we’ve done.... all this time.

[as C-3PO is looking at them all before his memory gets wiped]

POE: What are you doing there, 3PO?

C-3PO: Taking one last look, sir.... at my friends.

D-O: Sad.

[Muffled thudding]

BABU: Uh-oh.

ZORII: Night raids are going to start soon. I'll keep lookout.

POE: I'm coming with you.

ZORII: (scoffs) You still don't trust me, huh?

POE: Did you ever trust me?

ZORII: Nope.

[Laughs]

KYLO REN: Report, General Pryde.

ENRIC PRYDE: There's been a development, sir. The Knights of Ren have tracked the scavenger.

FRANTIS GRISS: To a settlement called Kijimi.

ARMITAGE HUX: Shall we destroy the city, Supreme....?

[Crackling]

[Babu Frik muttering]

C-3PO: I just had the idea. There's something else we could try.

[C-3PO powers down]

[Exclaiming in alien language]

[Distant explosions]

POE: How long's it been like this?

ZORII: First Order took most of the kids a long time ago. Can't stand the cries anymore. I've saved up enough to get out. I'm going to the Colonies.

POE: How? All those hyperlanes are blocked. That's the First Order Captain's medallion. I've never seen a real one.

ZORII: Free passage through any blockade. Landing privileges, any vessel.

[Helmet whirs]

ZORII: want to come with me?

POE: (sighs) I can't walk out on this war. Not till it's over. Maybe it is. We sent out a call for help at the Battle of Crait. Nobody came. Everyone's so afraid. They've given up.

ZORII: I don't believe you believe that. Hey. They win by making you think you're alone. Remember? There's more of us.

D-O: Squeaky wheel. I have a squeaky wheel. Squeak eliminated. Thank you. Very kind.

REY: Something’s not right about all of this.

FINN: Hmmmm?

REY: I know where I’ve seen it. The ship he was on. Ochi’s ship.

FINN: What?

REY: The day my parents left. They were on that ship.

FINN: Are you sure?

[Door opens]

ZORII: There's an incoming Destroyer.

POE: We got to go now. Did we get it? Babu?

BABU: Droid is ready!

[Spark crackles]

C-3PO: (in robotic voice) The Emperor's wayfinder is in the Imperial vault. At Delta 3-6, Transient 9-3-6, Bearing 3-2.... on a moon in the Endor system. From the southern shore. Only this blade tells. Only this blade tells.

[C-3PO powers down]

[Whooping]

FINN: The Endor system. Where the last war ended?

[Rumbling]

FINN: Rey!

REY: Ren’s Destroyer.

POE: He’s here?

[Rey senses something]

REY: Chewie?

FINN: What about him?

REY: He’s on Ren’s ship. He’s alive.

POE: What? How?

REY: He’s alive! He must've been on a different transport.

FINN: We got to go get him!

ZORII: Your friend's on that sky trash?

POE: I guess he is.

[after 3PO has translated the Sith message and had his memory wiped]

C-3PO: (in normal voice) Might I introduce myself? I am C-3PO, Human Cyborg Relations. And you are?

POE:Okay, that’s going to be a problem.

BABU: Hello. I Babu Frik.

C-3PO: Why, hello!

POE: 3PO, move your metal ass. We’re almost there.

C-3PO: How dare you! We’ve only just met!

ZORII: Poe. Might get you on a capital ship. Go help your friend.

POE: Zorii, I don't think I can take this.

ZORII: I don't care what you think.

POE: We have to go. Now.Come with us.

ZORII: Poe.

POE: Can I kiss you?

ZORII: (laughingly) Go.

WOMAN: We've done nothing wrong!

FEMALE STORMTROOPER: No sudden moves. What is that? Stop moving.

[Beeps, whirring]

[as they are about to go rescue Chewie from Kylo’s ship]

POE: Medallion's good. Clear for entrance into Hangar 12.

REY: Hang on, Chewie. We’re coming.

C-3PO: Whoever this Chewie person is, this is madness!

[after they break into Kylo’s ship and encounter two Stormtroopers]

STORMTROOPER: Credantials and manifest.

[Both scream]

FEMALE STORMTROOPER: Close the blast doors.

REY: You 3, stay there.

C-3PO: Happily.

POE: Which way?

FINN: Uh, no idea. Follow me.

[Door whirs]

STORMTROOPER 1: Drop your weapons!

[using the Jedi mind trick]

REY: It’s okay that we’re here.

[they lower their weapons]

STORMTROOPER 1: It’s okay that you’re here.

STORMTROOPER 2: It’s good.

REY: You’re relieved that we’re here.

STORMTROOPER 1: Thank goodness you’re here.

STORMTROOPER 2: Welcome, guys.

POE: (to Finn) Does she do that to us?

REY: We’re looking for a prisoner and his belongings. The cameras.

FINN: They said Chewie's this way. Rey, come on.

REY: The dagger is on this ship. We need it.

POE: Why?

REY: A feeling. I'll meet you back at the hangar.

FINN: Rey, you can't just....

POE: Chewie.

[Man whimpering]

[Creature grunts]

KYLO REN: Search the city again. She's close.

[rescuing Chewie]

[Finn chuckles with relief]

[Chewie grunts]

POE: Of course we came for you, Chewie.

[Grunts]

FINN: Yeah, Rey's here. She's going to get the dagger.

[Alarm blaring]

ENRIC PRYDE: Whose ship is this?

FINN: The ship's this way. Follow me.

FEMALE STORMTROOPER: Over here!

[as they try to make their way back to their ship]

FINN: Wrong way!

POE: There's not really a right way, is there?

STORMTROOPER 2: I found them.

FEMALE STORMTROOPER: Blast them!

[Chewie grunts]

STORMTROOPER 2: Over there! There they are. Get them!

[Stormtroopers groaning]

POE: We close?

FINN: Straight ahead.

FEMALE STORMTROOPER 2: Blast them!

STORMTROOPER 3: Halt!

[Grunts]

[Chewie grunts]

FINN: Poe!!!

[Poe groaning]

FINN: Are you okay?

[Footsteps approaching]

POE: Nope.

STORMTROOPER 4: You there, hands up! Drop your weapons now!

STORMTROOPER 5: Put your weapons down! Drop them!

STORMTROOPER 4: Drop them now!

POE: Hey, fellas.

FEMALE STORMTROOPER 3: Shut up, scum.

[Chewie laughs]

[Rey gets the Sith dagger from Kylo’s quarters]

REY'S MOTHER: No!

YOUNG REY: No!

REY: No.

[Kylo contacts Rey through their force bond]

KYLO REN: Rey.

[Gasps]

KYLO REN: Wherever you are.... you are hard to find.

REY: You’re hard to get rid of.

KYLO REN: I pushed you in the desert, because I needed to see it. I needed you to see it. Who you are. I know the rest of your story. Rey.

[Rey turns and lights up her lightsaber]

REY: (quietly) You’re lying.

KYLO REN: I never lied to you. Your parents were no one. They chose to be. To keep you safe.

REY: Don’t!

KYLO REN: You remember more than you say. I’ve been in your head.

REY: I don’t want this!

KYLO REN: Search your memories.

REY: No!!!

[Grunting]

[Rey attacks Kylo with her lightsaber, but he stops her]

KYLO REN: Remember them. See them.

[Rey then has vision of her parents]

[Breathing shakily]

REY'S MOTHER: My love. Rey, be brave.

REY'S FATHER: You'll be safer here. I promise.

YOUNG REY: Come back! (crying) No!

[Grunts]

[referring to her parents]

KYLO REN: They sold you to protect you.

REY: Stop talking.

KYLO REN: Rey, I know what happened to them.

[Rey grunting]

STORMTROOPER: Move it! Allegiant General, the scavenger is not with them.

ENRIC PRYDE: Take them away. Terminate them.

[Grunting]

KYLO REN: Tell me where you are. You don’t know the whole story. It was Palpatine who had your parents taken. He was looking for you. But they wouldn’t say where you were. So he gave the order.

REY'S MOTHER: She's not on Jakku. She's gone.

[Stabs]

REY'S MOTHER: No!

REY: No!

[Gasps]

[after Kylo’s discovered that Rey is on his Destroyer]

KYLO REN: So that's where you are. You know why the Emperor’s always wanted you dead.

REY: No.

KYLO REN: I’ll come tell you.

[Kylo breaks their vision bond]

[Gasps]

KYLO REN: She was in my quarters. Lock down the ship.

[after they have been captured on Kylo’s Destroyer and Hux is about to kill them]

ARMITAGE HUX: Actually.... I'd like to do this myself.

POE: What were you going to tell Rey before?

FINN: You still on that?

POE: Oh, I’m sorry, is this a bad time?

[Chewie groaning]

FINN: Yeah. Sort of is a bad time, Poe.

POE: Well, 'cause later doesn't really look like an option. If you're going to let something off your chest, maybe now's not the worst time to....

[they start bickering, then they hear the blaster going off and turn to see Hux has killed the Stormtroopers]

ARMITAGE HUX: I’m the spy.

POE: What?!

FINN: You?!

ARMITAGE HUX: We don’t have much time.

POE: I knew it.

FINN: No, you did not.

STORMTROOPER: What's your operation number?

[C-3PO speaks gibberish]

STORMTROOPER: That's not even a language.

[Rey grunting]

C-3PO: Oh, dear! My first laser battle.

REY: Where are the others?

C-3PO: They haven't come back.

[Engine whirring in distance]

REY: Find them. Go.

C-3PO: Yes.

D-O: Friends ahead.

[BB-8 chirps]

C-3PO: Oh, yes, there they are!

[as Hux leads them to the Falcon and is helping them to get off the Destroyer]

FINN: BB-8, come on!

ARMITAGE HUX: I'll shut down the impeders. You've got seconds.

POE: There she is. She's a survivor.

ARMITAGE HUX: Wait. Wait. Blast me in the arm. Quick.

FINN: What?!

ARMITAGE HUX: Or they’ll know.

[Finn blasts him in the leg, instead]

ARMITAGE HUX: No! Ahh!

[Groans]

FINN: Why are you helping us?

ARMITAGE HUX: I don’t care if you win. I need Kylo Ren to lose.

[Breathing heavily]

[after Kylo arrives on the Destroyer and faces Rey]

REY: Why did the Emperor come for me? Why did he want to kill a child? Tell me.

KYLO REN: Because he saw what you would become. You don’t just have power. You have his power. You’re his granddaughter. You are a Palpatine.

[Rey looks shocked, gasping softly]

KYLO REN: My mother was the daughter of Vader. Your father was the son of the Emperor. What Palpatine doesn’t know is we’re a dyad in the Force, Rey. 2 that are one.

[Wind whistling]

KYLO REN: We’ll kill him together and take the throne.

[Breathing raggedly]

[Kylo takes off his helmet]

KYLO REN: You know what you need to do. You know.

[he offers his hand to Rey]

REY: I do.

[Engine whirring]

[just then Poe and the others arrive on the Falcon]

POE: Hold her steady! Finn, move fast!

FINN: Rey! Come on!

[Breathing heavily]

FINN: Come on! I got you!

[Grunting]

[referring to Poe, Finn and Rey’s escaping on the Falcon]

ARMITAGE HUX: It was a coordinated incursion, Allegiant General. They overpowered the guards and forced me to take them to their ship.

ENRIC PRYDE: I see. (to one of the officers) Get me the Supreme Leader.

FIRST ORDER OFFICER: Yes, sir.

[Pryde takes one of the Stormtrooper’s weapons, blasts Hux and kills him]

[Grunts]

ENRIC PRYDE: Tell him we found our spy.

POE: I don't know why they're not following us, but I don't trust it.

[Chewie grunts]

POE: Landing gear's busted? How busted?

[Popping]

[Rey sighs]

REY: All that matters is the wayfinder. Finding Exegol.

FINN: That's what we're doing.

REY: He killed my mother. And my father. I’m going to find Palpatine.... and destroy him.

FINN: Rey.... that doesn’t sound like you.

[Device turns off]

FINN: Rey, I know you....

REY: People keep telling me they know me. I’m afraid no one does.

[Shuts lid]

PALPATINE: The Jedi apprentice still lives. Perhaps you have betrayed me. Do not make me turn my fleet against you.

KYLO REN: I know where she’s going. She’ll never be a Jedi.

PALPATINE: Make sure of it. Kill her.

[they arrive at Kef Bir]

[Device whirring]

[Crashing in distance]

[Wind whistling]

D-O: What.... What is that?

REY: It's the Death Star. A bad place from an old war.

POE: It's going to take us years to find what we're looking for.

C-3PO: Oh, dear.

REY: (quietly) "Only this blade tells." The wayfinder's there.

[Creature braying]

POE: Heads up.

[encounter Jannah and her group]

JANNAH: Rough landing.

POE: I've seen worse.

JANNAH: I've seen better. Are you Resistance?

POE: That depends.

JANNAH: We picked up a transmission from someone named Babu Frik.

C-3PO: Babu Frik? Oh, he’s one of my oldest friends.

JANNAH: HE said you'd come. He said you were the last hope.

REY: We have to get to that wreck. There is something inside there we need.

JANNAH: I can take you there by water.

FINN: Have you seen the water?

JANNAH: Not now. Too dangerous. We can go first light tomorrow.

REY: We can't wait that long. We don't have the time.

POE: Or the choice. Let's get that ship fixed. Do you have any spare parts?

JANNAH: Some. I'm Jannah.

POE: I'm Poe.

[BB-8 chirps]

D-O: Hello.

[Brays]

D-O: No thank you. No, thank you.

[BB-8 chirps]

[as they are trying to fix the Falcon whilst on Kef Bir]

C-3PO: What a dreadful situation. Is every day like this for you people? Madness.

POE: Did we ever find this volume control?

JANNAH: It's an O-6, but should work.

FINN: Thank you. This is a First Order part.

JANNAH: There's an old cruiser on the west edge. Stripped for parts. The one we were assigned to. The one we escaped in.

FINN:Okay, wait. You were First Order?

JANNAH: Not by choice. We were conscripted as kids. All of us. I was TZ-1719. Stormtrooper.

FINN: FN-2187.

JANNAH: You?

FINN: I never knew there were more.

JANNAH: Deserters? All of us here were stormtroopers. We mutinied at the Battle of Ansett Island. They told us to fire on civilians. We wouldn’t do it. We laid our weapons down.

FINN: All of you?

JANNAH: The whole company. (chuckles) I don’t even know how it happened. It wasn’t a decision, really, it was like....

FINN: An instinct. Feeling.

JANNAH: A feeling.

FINN: The Force. The Force brought me here. It brought me to Rey. And Poe.

JANNAH: You say that like you’re sure it’s real.

FINN: It’s real. I wasn’t sure then.... but I am now.

[BB-8 chirping]

POE: What is it, buddy?

[BB-8 continuing chirping]

POE: What do you mean you haven't seen her?

[after takes a skimmer and heads towards the wayfinder by herself]

JANNAH: She took the skimmer?

[Grunting]

[Grunts]

POE: What the hell was she thinking?!

FINN: Poe, we got to go after her.

POE: We'll get the Falcon fixed, and get out there as fast as we can.

FINN: No, we're going to lose her.

POE: Look, she left us! What do you want to do, swim?

FINN: She’s not herself. You have no idea what she’s fighting.

POE: And you do?

FINN: Yeah, I do. And so does Leia.

POE: Well, I’m not Leia.

FINN: That’s for damn sure.

[Grunting]

JANNAH: Finn. There's another skimmer.

[Water trickling]

[Metal groaning]

[Panting]

[Gasps]

[Grunting]

[Grunting]

[Door opening]

[Steam hissing]

[Indistinct whispering]

[Gasps softly]

[after Rey finds the wayfinder and sees a vision of herself as a Sith]

[Gasps]

SITH REY: Don’t be afraid of who you are.

[Rey grunting]

[they have short duel]

[Snarls]

[Grunts]

[after which Rey drops the wayfinder and Kylo picks it up]

[Indistinct whispering]

KYLO REN: Look at yourself. You wanted to prove to my mother that you were a Jedi.... but you've proven something else. You can’t go back to her now. Like I can’t.

[referring to the wayfinder]

REY: Give it to me.

KYLO REN: (shudders) The dark side is in our nature. Surrender to it.

REY: Give it.... to me.

[Breathing raggedly]

KYLO REN: The only way you’re getting to Exegol is with me.

[Kylo then destroys the wayfinder]

REY: No!!!

[they start dueling]

[Rey grunting]

[Kylo Ren grunts]

[as Leia senses Kylo and Rey dueling]

[R2-D2 chirping worriedly]

MAZ: Leia knows what must be done, R2. To reach her son now.... will take all the strength she has left.

[Breathing heavily]

[Muffled lightsabers clashing]

[Gasps]

FINN: Rey! Rey!!!

REY: No!

[Groans]

[Grunting]

[Yells]

[Grunts]

JANNAH: No, we can't follow them!

FINN: I can't leave her!

JANNAH: We can't!

FINN: Rey!!!

[Grunts]

[Panting]

[Rey grunting]

[Rey panting]

[Panting heavily]

[Grunting]

[Whimpers]

[as Kylo get the upper hand in their duel and is about to strike Rey he suddenly hears Leia through the Force]

LEIA: (softly) Ben.

[Leia exhales]

[Kylo drops his lightsaber, Rey catches it and impales him with it]

[Yells]

[Leia exhales deeply]

[but then she senses Leia death and stops]

REY: Leia.

[Breathing shakily]

[R2-D2 whines]

[Rey sobs softly]

[Rey sniffles]

[Kylo Ren gasping in pain]

[Breathing heavily]

[after Rey Force heals Kylo]

[Exhales sharply]

[Rey sniffles, sighs]

[Kylo Ren breathing heavily]

REY: I did want to take your hand. Ben’s hand.

[she then runs off and takes Kylo’s ship]

MAZ: Goodbye, dear Princess.

[after Leia’s death, and Rey leaving....]

LARMA D'ACY: Poe, something's happened.

POE: Finn.

FINN: This can't wait.

POE: We've got to see the General.

LARMA: She's gone.

[Chewie groans]

FINN: Chewie....

[Crying]

[Chewie weeping]

[Kylo hears Han’s voice]

HAN: Hey, kid.

[Kylo turns and sees Han]

HAN: I miss you, son.

[Breath trembling]

KYLO REN: Your son is dead.

HAN: (chuckles quietly) No. Kylo Ren is dead. My son is alive.

KYLO REN: You’re just a memory.

HAN: Your memory. Come home.

KYLO REN: It’s too late. She’s gone.

HAN: Your mother’s gone. But what she stood for, what she fought for.... that’s not gone.

[as Kylo is having a vision memory with Han]

HAN: (sighs) Ben.

KYLO REN: I know what I have to do.... but I don’t know if I have the strength to do it.

[Han touches Kylo’s face and smiles]

HAN: You do.

KYLO REN: Dad....

[Sobbing silently]

HAN: I know.

[Kylo throws his lightsaber into the water where it sinks forever and turns to see Han gone]

PALPATINE: (into hologram) The Princess of Alderaan has disrupted my plan.... but her foolish act will be in vain. Come to me on Exegol, General Pryde.

ENRIC PRYDE: As I served you in the old wars, I serve you now.

PALPATINE: Send a ship to a world they know. Let it burn. The Final Order begins. She will come, her friends will follow.

ENRIC PRYDE: Yes, my Lord.

SIMERO QUONIT: Levels holding steady at 85%.

MILON LENWITH: Captain. Kijimi is in range.

CHESILLE SABROND: Fire.

POE: Kijimi? How?

LARMA D'ACY: A blast from a Star Destroyer.

[Sighs]

LARMA D'ACY: A ship from the new Sith fleet. Out of the Unknowns.

BEAUMONT: The Emperor sent a ship from Exegol. Does that mean every ship in the fleet....

POE: Has planet-killing weapons. Of course they do. All of them. This is how he finishes it.

ROSE: Listen. It's on every frequency.

[Indistinct radio chatter]

BEAUMONT: "The Resistance is dead. The Sith flame will burn. All worlds, surrender or die. The Final Order begins."

ROSE: Leia made you acting General. What now?

[sitting by Leia body]

POE: (sighs) I got to tell you, I don’t really know.... how to do this. What you did.... I’m not ready.

LANDO: Neither were we.

[Poe sees Lando approaching]

LANDO: Han, Luke, Leia, me.... Who’s ever ready?

POE: How'd you do it? Defeat an empire with almost nothing.

LANDO: We had each other. That’s how we won.

FINN: Hey, don't touh that. That's my friend's.

D-O: Sorry. She is gone?

FINN: Yeah, she's gone. I don't know where.

D-O: I miss her.

FINN: I miss her, too. So, what's your name? I got to talk to you about something.

POE: I got to talk to you about something. I can’t do this alone. I need you in command with me.

[referring to D-O]

FINN: This droid has.... Thank you, I appreciate that.

POE: General.

FINN: General. This droid has a ton of information about Exegol.

POE: Wait, what? Cone face?

D-O: I am D-O.

POE: Sorry. D-O.

FINN: He was going to Exegol with Ochi of Bestoon.

POE: Why was Ochi going there?

FINN: To bring the little girl he was supposed to take from Jakku to the Emperor. He wanted her alive.

[after Rey has exiled herself on Ahch-To]

[Exhales sharply]

[Grunting]

[Panting]

[Porgs chitters]

[Inhales deeply]

[Grunts]

[she is about to throw Luke’s lightsaber into the burning wreckage of Kylo’s ship, suddenly Luke’s hand catches it]

[Gasps]

LUKE: A Jedi’s weapon deserves more respect.

REY: Master Skywalker.

LUKE: What are you doing?

[Rey continues her conversation with Luke’s Force spirit]

REY: I saw myself on the dark throne. I won’t let it happen. I’m never leaving this place. I’m doing what you did.

LUKE: I was wrong. It was fear that kept me here. What are you most afraid of?

REY: Myself.

LUKE: Because you’re a Palpatine.

[Rey looks surprised]

LUKE: Leia knew it, too.

REY: She didn’t tell me.

[Luke sits next to Rey]

REY: She still trained me.

LUKE: Because she saw your spirit. Your heart. Rey. Some things are stronger than blood. Confronting fear is the destiny of a Jedi. Your destiny. If you don’t face Palpatine.... it will mean the end of the Jedi. And the world will be lost. There’s something my sister would want you to have.

[Rey grunts]

[we see Rey take out a lightsaber from its hiding place on the island]

REY: (softly) Leia saber.

LUKE: It was the last night of her training.

[we see flashback of young Luke and Leia training]

[Grunting]

LUKE: Leia told me that she had sensed the death of her son at the end of her Jedi path. She surrendered her saber to me and said that one day.... it would be picked up again.... by someone who would finish her journey. 1,000 generations live in you now. But this is your fight. You’ll take both sabers to Exegol.

REY: I can’t get there. I don’t have the wayfinder. I destroyed Ren’s ship.

LUKE: You have everything you need.

[Indistinct whispering]

REY: 2 were made.

[Rumbling]

[R2-D2 chirping]

[upon seeing R2-D2]

C-3PO: Oh, hello. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And you are?

[R2-D2 chirps as he looks taken aback]

C-3PO: What?

[R2-D2 chirps]

C-3PO: Well, I am quite certain I would remember if I had a best friend.

[R2-D2 chirping a reply]

C-3PO: You want to put what in my head? Under no circumstances....

[the next shot shows R2 loading 3PO’s memory back into his head]

[Whirring]

C-3PO: (in robotic voice) Memory restoration complete. (in normal voice) R2, have you heard? I am going with Mistress Rey on her very first mission.

[R2-D2 chirping a reply]

C-3PO: I already have?

[R2-D2 chirping]

C-3PO: Picking up a signal? From whom?

FINN: All the information you need for an airstrike on Exegol.

POE: Yeah, except how to get there. Are you seeing these atmo readings?

FINN: It's a mess out there. Magnetic crossfields.

ROSE: Gravity wells, solar winds.

POE: How does a fleet even take off from there?

C-3PO: (to Poe and Finn) I’m terribly sorry. I’m afraid R2’s memory bank must be crossed with his logic receptors. He says he is receiving a transmission from Master Luke.

POE: That's an old craft ID. That's Luke Skywalker's X-wing.

C-3PO: It's transmitting course marker signals on its way to the Unknown Regions.

FINN: It's Rey.

[BB-8 chirping]

[Indistinct whispering]

FINN: She’s going to Exegol.

[we see Rey flying Luke’s ship to go to Exegol]

FINN: She’s showing us. She’s showing us how to get there.

POE: Then we go together.

[Indistinct announcing on P.A.]

BEAUMONT: Come on, buddy, we need you.

[as they are discussing their plan for getting to Exegol]

FINN: As long as those Star Destroyers are on Exegol we can hit them.

BEAUMONT: Hit them how?

ROSE: They can't activate their shields until they leave atmosphere.

POE: Which isn't easy on Exegol. Ships that size need help taking off. Nav can't tell which way's up out there.

WROBIE TYCE: So, how do the ships take off?

POE: They use a signal from a navigation tower, like this one.

FINN: Except they won't. Air team's going to find the tower, ground team's going to blast it.

VANIK: Ground team?

FINN: I have an idea for that.

POE: Once the tower's down, the fleet will be stuck in atmo.... for just minutes, with no shields, and no way out.

ROSE: We think hitting the cannons might ignite the main reactors.

LANDO: That's our chance.

BEAUMONT: We need to pull some Holdo maneuvers. Do some real damage.

FINN: Come on. That move is one in a million. Fighters and freighters can take out their cannons if there are enough of us.

NIEN NUNB: There aren't enough of us!

KAYDEL KO CONNIX: He's right. We'd be no more than bugs to them.

FINN: That's where Lando and Chewie come in.

[discussing their plan for getting to Exegol]

FINN: They’ll take the Falcon to the Core Systems. Send out a call for help for anybody listening.

POE: We’ve got friends out there. They’ll come if they know there’s hope.

[All murmuring]

[the group looks skeptical]

POE: They will. First Order wins by making us think we’re alone. We’re not alone. Good people will fight if we lead them.

FINN: Leia never gave up. And neither will we. We’re going to show them we’re not afraid.

POE: What our mothers and fathers fought for.... we will not let die. Not today. Today we make our last stand. For the galaxy. For Leia. For everyone we’ve lost.

FINN: They’ve taken enough of us. Now we take the war to them.

[Indistinct whispering]

[Breathing heavily]

FEMALE SITH OFFICER: (over comlink) She's on approach.

ENRIC PRYDE: All ships rise to development altitude.

[Emergency siren wailing]

POE: I know it's a rough ride.... but stay locked on Rey's course.

[R2-D2 chirps]

FEMALE FLEET TECHNICIAN: Clear run frequency.

SITH TROOPER: Captain, we have Resistance craft incoming.

CHESILLE SABROND: Allegiant General....

ENICE PRYCE: (over hologram) Use ion cannons!

[as the Resistance arrives in Exegol]

POE: Look at that fleet. Damn it! Welcome to Exegol!

VANIK: Watch your starboard, Wexley!

SNAP: Whoa!

POE: Get to their altitude. They can't fire on us without hitting each other. Don't give up! Help is coming.

FINN: There it is. Poe, I see it. I've got a visual on the tower.

[Breathing heavily]

[Lasers firing]

SNAP: Incoming TIEs!

POE: I see 'em! I got you, Finn.

FINN: You ready back there?

JANNAH: Never been readier.

FIRST ORDER OFFICER: They're targeting the navigation tower.... so the fleet can't deploy.

ENRIC PRYDE: Then we won't use that tower. Switch over the source of navigation signal to this ship. We'll guide the fleet out ourselves.

WROBIE TYCE: The navigation tower has been deactivated.

FINN: What?!

SNAP: Those ships need that signal. It's got to be coming from somewhere.

POE: They figured out what we're doing. Call off the ground invasion.

FINN: Wait. The nav signal's coming from that command ship. That’s our drop zone.

JANNAH: How do you know?

FINN: A feeling.

WROBIE TYCE: You want to launch a ground invasion on a Star Destroyer?

FINN: I don't want to, but we can't take out that ship's nav system from the air. Give us cover. We got to keep that fleet there till help arrives.

ROSE: We hope.

FINN: We hope.

POE: You heard the General. All Wings, cover that lander!

FRANTIS GRISS: They've landed a troop carrier.

ENRIC PRYDE: Jam the speeders.

MASIR TRACH: I can't.

ENRIC PRYDE: Why not?

MASIR TRACH: They're not using speeders.

FINN: Not bad for one lesson!

JANNAH: You had a good teacher!

BEAUMONT: Keep going!

[BB-8 chirping]

FINN: You're doing great, buddy! The tower's up ahead!

[Voices chanting in alien language]

[Chanting stops]

[The camera pans around Rey. Then...]

PALPATINE: Long have I waited…

[The girl turns around and finally comes face to face with Palpatine. The lightning shows the metal arm Palpatine has been connected to]

PALPATINE: ...for my grandchild to come home. (smiling) I never wanted you dead. I wanted you here... Empress Palpatine.

[He points towards the throne]

PALPATINE: You will take the throne.

[The scavenger girl gasps and steps back]

PALPATINE: It is your birthright to rule... here. It is in your blood. Our blood.

[Rey breathes shakily, continuing to step back]

REY: I haven’t come to lead the Sith.... I have come to end them.

PALPATINE: As a Jedi?

REY: Yes...

PALPATINE: No. Your hatred, your anger. You want to kill me? That is what I want. Kill me and my spirit will pass into you, as all the Sith live in me.... You will be Empress.... We will be one.

POE: Those thrusters are hot. Hew are we doing?

FINN: We're going to blow our way in, and take out that nav tower.

JANNAH: All hatches are blast-proof!

FINN: ALL right, BB-8, you're up!

JANNAH: I'll cover you!

[Grunts]

[Yells]

[BB-8 chirps]

[Jannah grunting]

[Beeps]

[Finn grunts]

JANNAH: This should do it.

[Finn grunts]

[System powering down]

FINN: There it goes!

POE: Nice one, Finn! Nav signal's down, but not for long!

MASIR TRACH: We're offline, sir.

ENRIC PRYDE: Reset the navigation signal!

FIRST ORDER TECHNICIAN: Minutes away, sir.

JANNAH: Finn, let's go!

FINN: No, no, wait, listen. The crown cannons have stopped. They're resetting their systems.

JANNAH: So?!

FINN: I got to go do something.

JANNAH: I'm staying with you.

SNAP: Still no Falcon or backup.

[R2-D2 chirps]

POE: I don't know, R2. Maybe nobody else is coming.

AFTAB: What do we do, General?!

POE: We got to hit them ourselves.

WROBIE TYCE: What can we do against these things?

POE: Just stay alive!

PALPATINE: The time has come!

[Gasping]

PALPATINE: With your hatred, you will take my life. And you will ascend.

REY: All you want is for me to hate, but I won’t. Not even you.

PALPATINE: Weak. Like your parents.

REY: My parents were strong. They saved me from you.

PALPATINE: Your Master Luke Skywalker was saved by his father. The only family you have here.... is me.

[Rumbling]

[Palpatine shows Rey the Resistance fighting with Palpatine’s fleet]

PALPATINE: They don’t have long.

[Rey shuddering]

PALPATINE: No one is coming to help them. And you are the one who led them here. Strike me down. Take the throne. Reign over a new Empire.... and the fleet will be yours. Only you have the power to save them. Refuse, and your new family.... dies.

[Rey looking emotional, nods her head reluctantly]

PALPATINE: Good.

[Grunts]

KYLO REN: Ow.

ROSE: Finn, where are you?! The lander's leaving! Finn!

FINN: Go without us. We're taking this entire ship down.

ROSE: What? How?

FINN: We're going to hit the command deck. Rose, please. Go.

BEAUMONT: Rose.

KAYDEL KO CONNIX: Rose.

JANNAH: I'll get the trigger!

PALPATINE: The ritual begins!

[Disciples chant]

PALPATINE: She will strike me down.... and pledge herself as a Sith.

[Disciples chanting]

[Disciples continue chanting]

PALPATINE: She will draw her weapon.

[Disciples chant]

[Rey lights her saber]

PALPATINE: She will come to me.

[Disciples chant]

[Grunting]

[Rey starts walking towards Palpatine]

PALPATINE: She will take her revenge.

[Disciples chant]

[Groans]

[Panting]

PALPATINE: And with a stroke of her saber.... the Sith are reborn!

[Disciples chant]

PALPATINE: The Jedi are dead!!!

[Disciples chant]

PALPATINE: Do it! Make the sacrifice!

[Breathing heavily]

[Grunting]

[just then Rey sees Kylo, now as Ben, smiles, nods and he nods his head in return]

[after Rey and Ben come together to defeat Palpatine]

PALPATINE: Stand together, die together!

[The Emperor strikes. Both Rey and Ben are incapacitated, their lightsabers flying away in the distance. As Palpatine pulls then to the ground, Force Energy is drained from the two heroes, startling him. The Emperor stares at his hands]

PALPATINE: The lifeforce of your bond.... A dyad in the Force...

[The mangled hands become whole again]

PALPATINE: A power like life itself.

[Rey and Ben are utterly helpless]

PALPATINE: Unseen for generations. And now.... the power of two... restores the one... true... Emperor.

[With his strengthened Sith powers, Palpatine drains more Force Energy out of his two prisoners. Rey shrieks, Ben grits his teeth. The Emperor cackles maniacally as his pupils light up under his robe]

POE: Snap, they’re on your tail!

SNAP: Yeah, I see 'em!

POE: No, no, no, Snap, Snap!

[the TIE fighter shoots at Snap’s X-Wing, Snap screams]

POE: No!!!

[Snap’s ship crashes and explodes]

PILOT: (over comlink) Alpha 3 is down. They're on my tail! I can't get.... (screams)

PILOT 2: (over comlink) They're everywhere!

PILOT 3: (over comlink) Delta Leader's hit!

PILOT 4: (over comlink) Losing altitude!

PILOT 5: (over comlink) General, what's our next move?!

PILOT 6: (over comlink) Poe, what now?!

POE: My friends.... I’m sorry, I thought we had a shot. But there’s just too many of them.

LANDO: (over comlink) But there are more of us, Poe. There are more of us.

POE: Look at this. Look at this.

[Laughing]

FINN: Lando, you did it. You did it!!!

POE: Hit those underbelly cannons. Every one we knock out is a world saved.

WEDGE: Nice flying, Lando.

SOLDIER: We have a ship down. We lost a Destroyer.

FEMALE FIRST ORDER OFFICER: Systems not responding.

[referring to the Resistance]

PRYDE: Where did they get all these fighter craft? They have no navy.

FRANTIS GRISS: It's not a navy, sir, it's just people.

ZORII: (over comlink) So long, sky trash!

POE: Who's that flyer?

ZORII: Take a guess, spice runner!

[Babu Frik whooping]

POE: Ha! Zorii! You made it!

[But someone else has made it too. The fully rejuvenated Emperor steps out of the dust, free off the Omrin harness and more powerful than ever before]

PALPATINE: Look what you have made.

[Disciples chanting]

[Ben grunts]

PALPATINE: As once I fell.... so falls the last Skywalker.

[he throws Ben into a chasm]

[Grunts]

[to his fleet as they are being attacked by the Resistance]

PALPATINE: Do not fear that feeble attack.... my faithful. Nothing will stop the return of the Sith!

[he starts to attack the entire Resistance with Force lightning]

POE: R2, my systems are failing!

[R2-D2 screeches]

POE: Does anyone copy?

[Laughing evilly]

[Groans]

[Breathing deeply]

[a weakened Rey watches the Resistance being destroyed by Palpatine’s Force lightning]

REY: Be with me. Be with me. Be with me.

[Rey hears the voices of past Jedi]

OBI-WAN: These are your final steps, Rey. Rise and take them.

ANAKIN: Rey.

AHSOKA: Rey.

KANAN: Rey.

ANAKIN: Bring back the balance, Rey, as I did.

LUMINARA: In the night, find the light, Rey.

MACE: You’re not alone, Rey.

YODA: Alone, never have you been.

QUI-GON: Every Jedi who ever lived lives in you.

ANAKIN: The Force surrounds you, Rey.

AAYLA: Let it guide you.

AHSOKA: As it guided us.

MACE: Feel the Force flowing through you, Rey.

ANAKIN: Let it lift you.

ADI: Rise, Rey.

QUI-GON: We stand behind you, Rey.

OBI-WAN: Rey.

YODA: Rise in the Force.

[Grunts]

KANAN: In the heart of a Jedi lies her strength.

OBI-WAN: Rise.

QUI-GON: Rise.

LUKE: Rey, the Force will be with you, always.

[Rey finally rises, stands before Palpatine and lights her saber]

[Breathing heavily]

PALPATINE: [to Rey] Let your death be the final word.... in the story of the Rebellion.

[as Rey is deflecting Palpatine’s Force lightning with her saber]

POE: I'm back on! This is our last chance. We got to hit those cannons now!

[Rey grunting]

PALPATINE: You are nothing! A scavenger girl is no match for the power in me. I am all the Sith!

[Grunts]

REY: And I...

REY: ...am all the Jedi.

[Grunts]

[Rey uses Luke and Leia’s lightsabers]

[Rey straining]

[Groaning]

[Rey grunts]

[Screaming]

[Then, the sabers disintegrate Palpatine's (Darth Sidious') body, killing him]

[Rey grunts]

[Disciples screaming]

[Jannah gasps]

C'AI: Poe, the command ship!

POE: Their fleet is stuck here! They're toast! Come on! Finn, you seeing this?!

ROSE: Finn didn't board the lander.

POE: They're still on that command ship?

[Both yelping]

[Jannah straining]

POE: I see them. I'm going to get them.

WROBIE TYCE: General, you won't make it.

POE: Trust me, I'm fast!

LANDO: Not as fast as this ship. Hold on, Chewie! (laughs)

[Chewie grunts]

JANNAH: Finn!!!

[Both yell]

FINN: No, Rey.

[Breathing shakily]

[Panting]

[Groans]

[Ben breathing heavily]

[Breath trembling]

[Breathing deeply]

[after Ben has used Force healing to resurrect Rey]

REY: (softly) Ben.

[Both breathing shakily]

[the two embrace and kiss]

[Chuckles]

[then Ben dies, his body vanishing as it becomes one with the Force]

[Cries softly]

[Leia’s body vanishes, also, and becomes the same as her son did]

FINN: There, look! Red 5 is in the air. Rey's alive.

POE: I see her.

FINN: People are rising up all over the galaxy.

[Panting]

FINN: (over comlink) Poe. We did it.

POE: We did it.

[Grunts]

[as the Resistance are celebrating their victory]

[Happy chatter and laughter]

[BB-8 chirps]

D-O: Happy.

ROSE: Chewie!

FEMALE SOLDIER: Hi!

MALE SOLDIER: Good job!

MAZ: Chewie. This is for you.

[she gives him medal]

[Chewie grunting softly]

[Grunts]

[R2-D2 chirps]

[Engine whirring]

C-3PO: Did you hear that?

[BB-8 chirping excitedly]

JANNAH: Where are you from, General?

LANDO: The Gold system. Well, what about you, kid?

JANNAH: Oh. I don't know.

LANDO: Well, let's find out.

[All cheering]

[Sobs softly]

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - JUNDLAND WASTES - LATE DAY

The Millennium Falcon soars over 4 JAWAS at a campfire near a sandcrawler. One of the Jawas exclaim in a Jawaese language.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS' HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY

Rey descends from the ramp of the landed ship and stares out at the desert terrain. As she heads away from the Falcon, BB-8 rolls down the ramp and watches her walk towards the Lars' moisture farm. Clouds hang low in the pale sky above the farm's entry dome. Reaching the edge of the recessed homestead, Rey gazes in and finds it partially filled with sand, the 2 moisture vaporators dirty and rust-stained. Pulling a metal panel from the sand, she sits on it and sleds down the slope into the homestead.

INT. LARS' HOMESTEAD - BURNT DINING AREA

She rises and gazes around, then exhales, her eyes filled with wonder. Walking to the entrance of the 35-year-old burnt dining area, she stands beneath its arched doorway and looks inside.

EXT. DESERT - LARS' HOMESTEAD - EARLY SUNSET

Later, she gently places the Skywalker lightsabers side-by-side on a cloth which lies on the sand. She folds in the edges of the cloth, covering the Jedi weapons, then ties them together with a leather strap and rests her hand on them. On one knee, she closes her eyes. The swaddled lightsabers sink into the sand before her. As they descend deeper, deeply rumbling, sand caves into the cavity, burying them forever. Rey opens her eyes and stares after them solemnly, then lifts a new lightsaber which she holds, fashioned from one end of her quarterstaff. She activates it. A yellow blade extends, and her pensive gaze flickers over it. She rises, extinguishing the saber, and sees an ELDERLY WOMAN with an ETOBI, an giraffelike creature, which lets out a grunt.

TATOOINE ELDER: There’s been no one for so long. Who are you?

REY: I’m Rey.

TATOOINE ELDER: Rey who?

Rey blinks, lowering her gaze. Her brow furrows. As she looks after the side, two ghosly figures start to appear. The Skywalker Twins (Luke and Leia) come into view, stainding side-by-side. They smile warmly at Rey. She smiles back, then turns to the elderly woman, her eyes shining.

REY: Rey Skywalker.

As the twin suns lift into the sky, Rey faces the horizon. BB-8 rolls to her side, and together, they watch the binary sunrise. Iris out, the end credits roll, along with John Williams' last Star Wars composition: a suite of the End Credits Theme, the Rise of Skywalker theme, the Anthem of Evil, the Imperial March, Rey's Theme, a reprise of The Rise of Skywalker and, to close things out, the Main Title theme, followed by the Throne Room theme to end the movie]
